        <h1>Hikes in Upstate NY</h1>
        <h2>Fillmore Glen</h2>
        <p>
         The journey begins, like many journeys do, in a parking lot. 
         Past the hot asphalt, lies a small swimming pond, the natural reservoir from the glen above.
         On this particular visit, a drought had significantly reduced the water level of the pond and of the feeding stream. 
         Still, the forest appears picturesque in the late morning light.
        </p>

        <p>Just a short walk beyond lies the "cow sheds", named for reasons unknown. 
        From here, gaze upon a trickling waterfall nestled into the cliff.</p>

        <p>A set of stone stairs, enshrined on a steep hillside, takes you up a hundred feet to the upper portion of the aforeseen waterfall. 
        Continuing through the serene deciduous forest, the trail continues along the creekside and within the confines of the glen walls. 
        A quaint series of both wood and stone footbridges makes several crossings over the creek throughout the duration of the hike.</p>

        <p>Here, one can feel the peacefulness of the glen. 
        At the time, the slightly humid air was cool and comfortable under the canopies of the trees. 
        Although the trail runs adjacent to the creek, there were not many insects to bite or bother.</p>

        <p>After a series of waterfalls, twists, and turns, the path turns sharply uphill, a trail which (as I did) you may deem to be too steep, too unshaded, and too boring to traverse.
        Here was where the journey ended, at least until the return walk back to the pavement. On the way down, the cliffs and waterfalls seem to take a different perspective, and you may discover new beauty that had gone unnoticed during the trip up.</p>

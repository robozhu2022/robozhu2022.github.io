                    Welcome and thanks for stopping by!
                    I started this blog as a way to record some of my thoughts, adventures, and photos while limiting my use of social media.
                    Here you'll find a variety of content on travel, food, events, reviews, or whatever else I feel like sharing.
                    It's my website! :)
                </p>

                <p>
                    The site might look a little rough around the edges.
                    That's because I'm coding it myself in HTML in true DIY fashion.
                    At the time of writing, the site is not really designed with smartphone viewing in mind, although it works at least partially.
                    As I continue this project, the site may change and pick up enhanced features.
                    In fact, the website itself is its own content besides the articles I post.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Have any questions or comments?
                    Found an issue with the website?
                    Email me at bkjohnson2009@gmail.com and I'll get back to you!
                </p>

                    See you out there,

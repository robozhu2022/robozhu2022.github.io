            <p>
                Come one come all to see the sites, sounds, and most importantly tastes of Greektown!
                The 32nd annual "Taste of Greektown" festival located in Chicago's West Loop just took place in August, and I wanted to share some experiences and tips for you, my home audience.

            <h2>Getting there</h2>
            <p>
                My partner and I visited on a weekend evening, probably the busiet time to go.
                Greektown is located in Chicago's West Loop just northeast of I-90/I-290 interchange.

                However you prefer to get to West Loop you can use to navigate to the festival.
                The transit lines aren't particularly close, so by rail you'll need to walk a bit from the nearest station.
                A few bus lines are available in the area as well.
                For our circumstances, we decided to drive and park nearby.
                There is plenty of potential street parking to the east and north of the neighborhood, but unsurpisingly it was packed at the time we went (around 5:30).
                After a few minutes of searching, we were able to grab a spot only a five minute walk away from the festival.
                If you were to go earlier in the afternoon, you may have an easier time. (or just take transit and don't worry about parking!)
            </p>
            <p>
                One thing to note is that by law, street festivals are free to enter (as they take place on public avenues).
                While there was a $7 "suggested donation", the volunteers at the gate were very pushy in soliciting for them.
                Although I just ignored them, it seemed like some people were confused or even tricked into thinking they were required to pay to enter.
                Don't fall for it!
                (I hear this is common at other street fests as well)

            <h2>Things to do</h2>
            <p>
                As the name implies, Taste of Greektown is focused on the foods (and I'll get to that!).
                But in addition, its got what you would expect from any other street fest.
                A variety of merchant stalls line the street selling various goods.
                The quality ranges from good (some leather work), average (jewelry), bad (spray paint art), to fake: authentic (tm) Ray-Bans!
            </p>
            <p>
                There is a DJ stand which was a little too focused on modern beats and remixes, and the music was absurdly loud for this type of street fest.
                Still, the energy really picked up when they started mixing in actual Greek music!
                Another stage featured legit Greek grandpas playing live music.
                A few strangers joined in on the dance circle!

            <h2>A review of two competing restaurants: Spectrum vs. Athena</h2>
            <p>
                Now we get to the main attraction.
                After all, it should be called Taste of Greektown for a reason, right?
                Here is my head-to-head review of two restaurant foodstands that we tried: Spectrum Bar and Grill, and Athena Greek Restaurant.
                Both were on the main Halsted St. concourse of the fest and were very popular (Athena much more so).
                While other eateries also participate in the fest, we didn't try any others, so I can't comment on their tastiness (or lack of).
            </p>
            <p>
                Spectrum was an attraction primarily for their grilled lamb plate, which cost roughly $24.
                They also offered grilled chicken, which we did not get.
                The lamb was very delicious and came off the bone easily.
                While seasoned quite simply, the flavor was abundant.
                The sides were very lackluster, however.
                A small bread roll, simple salad, and rather unflavorful rice; not worth the price of admission, and I would say quite lacking in 'Greek' flavor.
                Overall, I rate Spectrum's dish a 2/5 in this competition.

                Athena's food stand was bigger, yet more crowded.
                It's no wonder why, as I rate the food much higher than Spectrum.
                We ordered a sample platter as well as spanakopita (spinach and feta in a crispy wrap) for a total of about $40.
                The sample platter consisted of grilled chicken, veggies, rice, salad, and pita bread served with tzatziki sauce.
                The spanakopita also came with rice, salad, and tzatziki sauce.
            </p>
            <p>
                I give high recommendation to Athena's dishes.
                The flavors and textures on everything was very good.
                While I would say the Spectrum lamb was better than the Athena chicken, it is a close competition, and the flavors of the rice and veggies weren't messing around either.
                A minor complaint is that the pita bread was excessively chewy.
                While we did order two dishes, both were worth the price in terms of not only taste but quantity.
                Overall, I rate Athena's dishes a 5/5 in this competition and declare them the winner! (sorry Spectrum, your sad cheap sides were unforgivable)

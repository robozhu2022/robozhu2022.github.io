            <h2>Fillmore Glen</h2>
            <p>
                During a recent family visit in upstate New York I had the opportunity to go on a wonderful little hike.
                Fillmore Glen State Park is the site of today's post.
                Not too far from Ithaca, NY, the glen features serene forests, waterfalls, streams, and bridges.
                Read on to find out more!
            </p>

                The journey at Fillmore Glen begins, like many journeys do, in a parking lot.
                Past the hot asphalt and covered pavilion lies a small swimming pond, the natural reservoir from the glen above.
                On this particular visit, a drought had significantly reduced the water level of the pond and of the tributary stream.
                I previously visited the glen about one year prior and found plenty of water throughout the hike.
                Still, the forest here appears picturesque in the late morning light.

                Just a short walk beyond lies the "cow sheds", so called because local cows would supposedly take shelter from rainstorms underneath the overhanging rock face.
                From here, gaze upon a trickling waterfall nestled into the cliffside.

                After looping back towards the pond, a set of stone stairs enshrined on a steep hillside takes you up a hundred feet to the upper portion of the aforeseen waterfall.
                Continuing through the greenery, the trail continues along the creekside and within the confines of the glen walls, which grow increasingly but subtly steep.
                A quaint series of both wood and stone footbridges makes several crossings over the creek throughout the duration of the hike.

                Here, one can feel the peacefulness of the glen.
                At the time, the slightly humid air was cool and comfortable under the canopies of the trees.
                Although the trail runs adjacent to the creek, there were not many insects to bite or bother; most stayed confined near the first few inches of the water.
                I spotted a few groups of small fish in the creek, each roughly one inch in length.
                I'm not sure that the ecosystem or water level can support anything larger.

                After a series of waterfalls, twists, and turns, the path turns sharply uphill, a trail which (as I did) you may deem to be too steep, too unshaded, and too boring to traverse.
                Here was where the journey reversed, taking me back the way I came through the glen trail.
                I did see the trail split off to an upper rim trail, but elected to stay close to the water.
                On the way down, the cliffs and waterfalls seem to take a different perspective, and you may discover new beauty that had gone unnoticed during the trip up.

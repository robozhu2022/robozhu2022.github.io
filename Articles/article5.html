            <h1>2022 Book Reviews!</h1>
            <h3>31.12.2022</h3>
            <p>
                Another year has come and gone. It's gone forever!
            </p>
            <p>
                At the start of 2022, I made a goal for myself to read more often. 
                At the end of 2022, having read 28 books, I think I've accomplished that goal! 
                This time, I want to provide a mini review of each book and offer my recommendations from this year. 
                Let's get to it!
            </p>
            <h2>Anna Karenina (Leo Tolstoy)</h2>
            <p>
                Brilliant writing and character building in a classic novel. 
                It is pretty long and I often felt the main 'drama' was contrived and petty, particularly with the titular character Anna. 
                The chapters devoted to Levin and his philosophizing about farming were the most enjoyable. 
                Overall recommendation 3/5.
            </p>
            <h2>Project Hail Mary (Andy Weir)</h2>
            <p>
                A very entertaining sci-fi read with several twists and turns. 
                Very enjoyable and relatively quick to read, I would recommend it to general readers.
                My main complaint is that protagonist's personality is far too juvenile, leading to some eye-rolling dialogue and unrealistic actions. 
                Overall recommendation 4/5.
            </p>
            <h2>Winter (Karl Ove Knausgård)</h2>
            <p>
                A thoughtful biographical meditation on many aspects of life, described from the perspective of the author writing to his soon-to-be-born daughter.
                One of four books in the 'seasons quartet', although it stands on its own. 
                Each chapter is generally a self-contained reflection on one thought, event, or 'thing'.
                Some may consider it a bit pretentious, but it was perfect for me.
                Overall recommendation 4/5.
            </p>
            <h2>Spring (Karl Ove Knausgård)</h2>
            <p>
                Another biographical work from KOK in the seasons quartet. 
                Not quite as good as Winter in my opinion, and much more personal in scope. 
                It is an interesting reflection on being a father and a husband, which may strike a deeper chord with some. 
                I enjoyed it, but would only recommend to fans of KOK or the previous book, Winter. 2/5.
            </p>
            <h2>Crime and Punishment (Fyodor Dostoevsky)</h2>
            <p>
                Another Russian lit classic which holds up to its praise. 
                A complicated look into the human psyche of murder and guilt. 
                It is a long novel, and dostoevsky does have a tendency to write rambling fever-dream-esque inner monologues of characters which can become repetitive and tedious. 
                My favorite bits were the interplay between the murderer and the police investigating the crime, where it isn't clear how much either party knows about the other. 
                Overall recommendation 3/5 for literature fans.
            </p>
            <h2>War and Peace (Leo Tolstoy)</h2>
            <p>
                Clearly I had a Russian literature phase this year, but this one must be read. 
                It is long. Looooong. 
                But, reading a few chapters every now and then is like tuning in to a long-running Netflix/HBO series. 
                I read it over the course of a few months and really came to enjoy all the different characters, some who have arcs and others who generally do not. 
                It is epic in scope, with decades of events and dozens of characters, and it was particularly satisfying seeing the characters' personalities or circumstances change through time. 
                My biggest complaint is that for such a dramatic tale, it ends rather with a whimper than a bang. 
                Overall recommendation 4/5.
            </p>
            <h2>The Remains of the Day (Kazuo Ishiguro)</h2>
            <p>
                This is great writing, period!  
                It is a thoughtful reflection on post-WW2 Britain with themes of aristocracy, politics, national and personal identity, and professional duty.  
                The portrayal of this traditional English butler Stevens is fascinating, approachable, humorous, and rather sad. 
                It is also a page turner and won't take you too long to finish (unlike those Russian novels!). 
                Overall recommendation 5/5.
            </p>
            <h2>Never Let Me Go (Kazuo Ishiguro)</h2>
            <p>
                Another great novel by Kazuo Ishiguro. 
                It features a big reveal which is hinted at throughout the first part of the novel. 
                This is science fiction not through space battles or laser weapons but through the careful consideration of a society's ethics and values. 
                Beyond the broader moral consideration, the book is an intimate character study of a few close classmates and friends. 
                Overall recommendation 5/5. 
            </p>
            <h2>Humble Pi (Matt Parker)</h2>
            <p>
                A humorous look at mathematical blunders and their consequences in the real world (or sometimes not). 
                A quick and quick-witted read, it is easily approachable even if you aren't so mathematically inclined. 
                Overall recommendation 4/5. 
            </p>
            <h2>How Not to Be Wrong (Jordan Ellenberg)</h2>
            <p>
                Admittedly, I only finished about 1/2 of this book. 
                I was attracted to its charms after reading Humble Pi (see above), but unfortunately this one falls flat. 
                It lacks humor and personality, although admittedly it is a bit better at explaining the 'math' behind the mistakes. 
                Overall recommendation 1/5. 
            </p>
            <h2>Breathe (James Nestor)</h2>
            <p>
                I'm not sure how I feel about this book. 
                One one hand, it reads as a combo self-help, motivational, philosophical book, which I am admittedly attracted to. 
                On another hand, James Nestor references many breathing related studies, and after a decent look into the research I can't necessarily say anything is particularly unscientific. 
                But on the OTHER hand, this reads like a bunch of nonsense quackery, claiming that breathing a certain way can turn you into superman (if you align your chakras carefully). 
                Overall recommendation 2/5, because even though I enjoyed reading this, I felt like I was being scammed into something...
            </p>
            <h2>Steppenwolf (Hermann Hesse)</h2>
            <p>
                A fever-dream character study in another classic novel. 
                It's actually a bit difficult to describe and I still don't fully understand the meaning of the book. 
                It was a good read though and made me reflect about some aspects of my personality and my life. 
                Perhaps it needs another read to take full effect. 
                Overall recommendation 3/5. 
            </p>
            <h2>The Easy Life in Kamusari (Shion Miura)</h2>
            <p>
                Another quick and light-hearted read. 
                It focuses on the coming-of-age of a Japanese boy sent to a mountain town to work in foresty. 
                It has a lot of heart and garners an appreciate for nature and society's role within nature. 
                Overall recommendation 4/5. 
            </p>
            <h2>Born a Crime (Trevor Noah)</h2>
            <p>
                A great autobiography of comedian Trevor Noah about his upbringing in Apartheid South Africa. 
                The events of his childhood are at times hilarious, insightful, sad, terrifying, and anger-inducing. 
                It's a fantastic read which I highly recommend to anybody. 5/5
            </p>
            <h2>Digital Minimalism (Cal Newport)</h2>
            <p>
                An interesting perspective on how technology has impacted our lives for the worse, and how to overcome those impacts - namely by using technology in a minimal, deliberate way. 
                It has some very interesting ideas which I was motivated to implement in my own life with varying degrees of success. 
                Overall a book I would like to come back to and reflect on more. 4/5 
            </p>
            <h2>The Three-Body Problem, The Dark Forest, and Death's End (Liu Cixin)</h2>
            <p>
                I did a big review on this series in a previous post. Highly recommended to sci-fi fans! 4/5
            </p>
            <h2>How to Avoid a Climate Disaster (Bill Gates)</h2>
            <p>
                A good look at the state of climate change today: it's causes, the effects, and how we might address the challenges. 
                At times Bill Gates feels like he's trying to overcompensate or explain away the enormous emissions he generates himself, which leaves a bad taste in the mouth. 
                But when he discusses the technical aspects of climate change and what we can do to prevent it, it provides a very good summary. 
                Overall recommendation 3/5, more for those who are interested in this topic. 
            </p>
            <h2>A Brief History of Time (Stephen Hawking)</h2>
            <p>
                This popular book is well worth the read. 
                While it contains a lot of insight on physics, 'modern' theories (although the book now is a bit out of date), and the nature of the universe, I was also surprised how much subtle humor Stephen Hawking conveys! 
                It was a pretty fun read and is still approachable for those without a physics background. 5/5
            </p>
            <h2>The Sun Also Rises (Ernest Hemingway)</h2>
            <p>
                A classic Hemingway novel. 
                It feels a bit like going on vacation to Spain (which is the subject of the book), minus the depression and alcoholism. 
                I enjoyed the book thoroughly and would like to re-read it some time. 
                Overall recommendation 3/5. 
            </p>
            <h2>For Whom the Bell Tolls (Ernest Hemingway)</h2>
            <p>
                A fantastic anti-war novel. 
                While I do think the book could be condensed by 15-20% (a lot of repetition in writing), it never felt 'too long'. 
                It has memorable characters and beautiful descriptions of horrific events in the Spanish civil war. 
                Certainly written from experience, based on Hemingway's own times working in the war as a journalist. 4/5
            </p>
            <h2>An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth (Chris Hadfield)</h2>
            <p>
                I've read this book several times already, so I'm biased. 
                It's a great read! 
                A bit autobiographical, a bit self-help/motivation, it is really cool to see into the life of a decorated astronaut. 
                It reveals some aspects of the astronaut life which probably aren't thought of to the average person (for instance, many astronauts spend years or even decades training and may not end up flying to space at all). 
                I love this book. 5/5
            </p>
            <h2>Norwegian Wood (Haruki Murakami)</h2>
            <p>
                If you're familiar with Murakami works, well, it's another Murakami book (you've probably read it already though). 
                While I enjoyed it, I wouldn't say it left a very profound impact on me, and it suffers from a few tropes and 'wacky' Murakami characters. 
                Overall recommendation 3/5. 
            </p>
            <h2>The Color of Magic (Terry Pratchett)</h2>
            <p>
                The first Discworld book by fantasy satirist Terry Pratchett. 
                It's another fun, light read, offering fantasy, adventure, action, magic, humor, excitement, and much more! 
                As is Pratchett's style, he often pokes fun at typical tropes and expectations. 
                The ending was very open-ended without a satisfying wrap-up, which slightly dings the book for my personal preferences.
                Overall recommendation 4/5.
            </p>
            <h2>Mort (Terry Pratchett)</h2>
            <p>
                Another Discworld book focused on the character of Death, and all the metaphorical and literal fun which entails. 
                Not quite as good as The Color of Magic, it is sometimes unfocused and meandering, and the characters' actions are sometimes strangely unmotivated. 
                Still, it was fun to read and didn't take too long, so what's the harm? 
                Overall recommendation 3/5.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whew, that's all. So long and happy new year! (observant readers will note that less than 28 books are listed, but these are the main 'novels' that I read)
